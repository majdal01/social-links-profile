## My process

Mostly focused on ensuring responsiveness and semantic markup. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Well, I actually have an issue with the solution. My a-tags are not as wide as they should be. But I struggle to find out, how to make them without loosing the resonsiveness

Should I maybe have used grid??
